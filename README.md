Snyk helps you find, fix and monitor for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, both on an ad-hoc basis and as part of your CI (Build) system.

The Snyk Gradle plugin tests and monitors your Gradle dependencies.

## Using the Snyk Plugin for Gradle
The latest version of the plugin is released at the [Gradle Plugins Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.snyk.gradle.plugin.snykplugin).
Import the plugin using the plugin DSL

Groovy:
```groovy
plugins {
  id "io.snyk.gradle.plugin.snykplugin" version "0.5.1"
}
```

Kotlin
```kotlin
plugins {
  id("io.snyk.gradle.plugin.snykplugin") version "0.5.1"
}
```

### Setting:

Groovy:
```groovy
snyk {
    arguments = '--all-sub-projects'
    severity = 'low'
    api = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
    autoDownload = true
    autoUpdate = true
}
```
Kotlin:
```kotlin
snyk {
    setArguments("--all-sub-projects")
    setSeverity("low")
    setApi("xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")
    setAutoDownload(true)
    setAutoUpdate(true)
}
```

all fields are optional

- **arguments** - add extra arguments to the Snyk CLI. See Snyk CLI help for more information. In this example it scans all subprojects for gradle
- **severity** - what is the severity threshold. Leave empty to only show the vulnerabilities but not break
- **api** - api key that can be found on the settings page of your (free) Snyk account. Alternatively you can set an environment variable `SNYK_TOKEN` and omit it here
- **autoDownload** - automatically download the CLI is none is installed (default = true)
- **autoUpdate** - update the CLI if there is a newer version (only if downloaded by gradle plugin) (default = false)
